# Docker Compose LEMP stack with Latest Versions

This repository contains a little `docker-compose` configuration to start a `LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MariaDB, PHP)` stack.

## Details

The following versions are used.

* PHP latest avaliable (FPM) - With MySQLi driver
* Nginx latest avaliable
* MariaDB latest avaliable
* phpMyAdmin 5 version Latest

The versions used in these containers are the latest available for each official container of the indicated service, if you want to use a different or specific version you can edit the dockerfile files of each container in the `config` folder or if you want to add new commands within each container, extensions, services, etc., you can edit each dockerfile of each of them to customize it according to your needs.

## Configuration

The Nginx configuration can be found in `config/nginx/`.

The `app` folder is a static path and you can upload the files of your applications in real time to be deployed and displayed by the nginx and php service.
You can create multiple virtualhost inside `nginx.conf` file or you can create separate files as you like, and adjust the path of your applications remember `/var/www/html` is point to `app` folder, so you have to play with these paths to configure your web applications correctly.

The PHP configuration can be found in `config/php/`.

The MariaDB configuration can be found in `config/mariadb/`.

You can also set the following environment variables, for example in the included `.env` file:

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
|APP_NAME|The name used when creating a container.|
|WORKSPACE_TIMEZONE|The timezone used when creating a db container.|
|MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD|The MySQL root password used when creating the db container.|
|MARIADB_DATABASE|The MySQL database used when creating the db container.|
|MARIADB_USER|The MySQL user other than root used when creating the db container.|
|MARIADB_PASSWORD|The MySQL normal user password used when creating the db container.|
|DATA_PATH_HOST|The path used when creating a db container to store the database data in a way accessible to the host server.|

*If it is run in a windows dockerized environment with WLS2, the mysql data path may run with error, in this case disable the static path or create the data manually after it has been deployed.*
